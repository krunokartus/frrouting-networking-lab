# Lab 03: OSPF Multiple Areas + NAT

## Goal
The goal of this lab is to configure **Multi-area OSPFv2**. It demonstrates how OSPF uses areas to scale networks, specifically focusing on the role of an **Area Border Router (ABR)** that connects the backbone (Area 0) with a non-backbone area (Area 1).

## Topology
**PC1** (Area 0) --- **R1** (Area 0) --- **R2** (ABR: Area 0/1) --- **R3** (Area 1) --- **PC2** (Area 1)

## Concepts
- **Backbone Area (Area 0):** The core area that all other areas must connect to.
- **Area Border Router (ABR):** A router that has interfaces in multiple areas. Its job is to summarize topology information between areas.
- **Inter-Area Routes:** Routes learned from other areas (noted with 'O IA' in the routing table).
- **LSA Type 3 (Summary LSA):** How ABRs share network information between areas.

## IP plan
| Node | Interface | IP Address | OSPF Area |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PC1** | eth1 | 192.168.10.10/24 | N/A (Host) |
| **Router1** | eth1 | 192.168.10.1/24 | Area 0 |
| **Router1** | eth2 | 10.0.0.1/30 | Area 0 |
| **Router2** | eth1 | 10.0.0.2/30 | Area 0 |
| **Router2** | eth2 | 10.0.0.5/30 | Area 1 |
| **Router3** | eth1 | 10.0.0.6/30 | Area 1 |
| **Router3** | eth2 | 192.168.20.1/24 | Area 1 |
| **PC2** | eth1 | 192.168.20.10/24 | N/A (Host) |

## Verification
1. **Connectivity test:** From **PC1**, ping **PC2**: `ping 192.168.20.10`
2. **Verify ABR role:** On **Router2**, check OSPF neighbor status on both interfaces: `show ip ospf neighbor`
3. **Analyze Routing Table:** On **Router1**, look for "Inter-Area" routes: `show ip route`
   - *Expectation:* You should see **`O IA`** for networks in Area 1.
4. **LSA Inspection:** On **Router1**, check for Type 3 LSAs generated by the ABR: `show ip ospf database summary`

## Verification results
I have verified the multi-area OSPF configuration by checking the routing tables and neighbor adjacencies across the different areas.

### 1. Inter-Area Routing
On **Router1** (Area 0), I checked the routing table to verify that it learned the route to the remote network (PC2) via the ABR (Router2). As expected, the route to **192.168.20.0/24** is marked with `O IA` (OSPF Inter-Area).

### 2. ABR Neighbor Adjacencies
On **Router2** (the ABR), I verified that it has formed full adjacencies with neighbors in both Area 0 (**Router1**) and Area 1 (**Router3**).

Router2 has the biggest OSPF database, because it has to store information about both Area 0 and Area 1.

### 3. Connectivity
A final ping from **PC1** to **PC2** confirms that traffic is successfully navigating through Area 0, across the ABR, and through Area 1 to reach its destination.
